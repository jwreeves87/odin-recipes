    <p>
      This recipe for smoked baby back ribs will yield ribs that are more competition style. That means they'll be stickier and sweeter than most. This also means they produce a tender bite of meat that pulls from the bone easily but the meat does not fall from the bone.<br><br>
      If you prefer ribs that are more tender, simply cook the ribs longer and they will continue to tenderize.<br><br>
      My preferred wood of choice for this smoke is <strong>Apple Wood</strong>, but use the one you like the best.
