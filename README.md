# odin-recipes
First Odin HTTP project

This is my first public project. I'll be working through basic git commands, setting up a new repo on GitHub, and creating some basic pages with various kinds of text, lists, links, and images.

Here's to a place where I can store my smoker recipes and other cooking recipies i've enjoyed in the past.

I've got a basic ribs recipe for now but will be adding other favorites soon!
